- Some understanding of TypeScript -- if coming from an OOP background, this
will feel like second nature.

# Introduction - What is Angular?
Angular is a JavaScript framework that is used to create single-page
applications, or SPAs. These are called single-page because they consist of one
HTML file. All of the content is dynamically rendered. This is much
faster than fetching new data from a server for every page change -- loading a
completely new HTML page. This results in a much better user experience, feeling
almost like a mobile application, because the page never refreshes.

Angular is often used with TypeScript instead of vanilla JavaScript. Way back in
1995 when Brendan Eich wrote JavaScript in 10 days, no thought was put into
type safety or failing fast. Instead, the language was fitted with a number of
ways to fail silently, leading to strange and seemingly undefined behavior. For
some reason, it quickly took over the Internet, and its been one of the most
popular programming languages ever since.

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds object-oriented capabilities
to the language, and most importantly, types. The syntax should be easy to pick
up if you know a programming language like Java or C++. TypeScript is one of the
fastest growing programming languages out there today, and it rivals other
languages like Rust, R, and Python in terms of how beloved it is by developers.
